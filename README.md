# N-Queens Optimizer
#### C++

Input is an initial setup of N number of queens on an N x N sized chessboard. Output is a setup of queens with minimal conflicts using the smallest amount of moves (two queens are in conflict if they attacked each other, moving a queen one space counts as one move).

Implemented using breadth first search and a hill climbing algorithm.
